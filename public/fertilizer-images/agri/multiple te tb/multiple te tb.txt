Multiple TE TB Tablets – Complete Micronutrient Mix for Crops

Prevent Deficiencies | Support Balanced Growth | Boost Yield Quality

ViviGro Multiple TE TB Tablets provide a balanced blend of essential trace elements (TEs), including Iron (Fe), Zinc (Zn), Manganese (Mn), Copper (Cu), Boron (B), and Molybdenum (Mo), all in plant-available forms. These micronutrients play a critical role in enzyme activity, chlorophyll formation, flower development, and overall plant metabolism.

Formulated for easy application, the tablets dissolve quickly in water and are ideal for foliar spray or fertigation—helping prevent and correct multiple micronutrient deficiencies in a single treatment.

Application Method:
Dissolve tablets in water and apply as a foliar spray or through fertigation. For best results, follow crop-specific recommendations or consult an agronomist.
