ViviGro Max Ammonium Sulphate – Nitrogen & Sulfur Fertilizer

High Nitrogen Supply | Boosts Protein Formation | Improves Soil Health

ViviGro Max Ammonium Sulphate is a reliable source of 21% Nitrogen (N) and 24% Sulfur (S), making it ideal for crops requiring both nutrients for healthy growth. The nitrogen promotes vigorous vegetative development, while sulfur supports chlorophyll formation and enhances nitrogen use efficiency. It’s especially beneficial in sulfur-deficient soils and helps improve overall crop quality.

This fertilizer dissolves easily and is suitable for use in basal applications, top dressing, and fertigation systems across a wide range of crops.

Application Method:
Apply directly to the soil or through fertigation based on crop requirements. Consult an agronomist for accurate dosage and timing.
