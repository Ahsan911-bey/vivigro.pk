        ViviGroâ€™s journey began with its founder, Yasir Syed, who grew up on a family-owned dairy and beef ranch in a remote village in Pakistan. His early exposure to sustainable farming practices in a resource-scarce environment shaped his deep appreciation for nature        </p>
        <p>
        After moving to Canada in the early 2000s, Yasir observed that sustainable farming was underutilized. In 2006, he founded a company focused on sustainable and organic fertilizers for the horticulture market in British Columbia.        </p>
        <p>
        In 2018, he established ViviGro Sustainable Solutions to cater to prairie province crops, aiming to improve soil health and food quality through innovative, eco-friendly fertilizers. Over the years, ViviGro has expanded its reach, serving approximately 1 million acres of commercial farmland with customized programs.        </p>
        <p>
        The company has built a reputation for its unique formulations, scientific and Holistic practices, and commitment to educating farmers. Strategic partnerships, such as with Growers Supply Co. to form Ropana Grower Solutions Ltd., have furthered its mission to support sustainable agriculture        </p>
